# Magic 8 Ball 

2nd challenge of the complete 2021 Flutter developer course. In this app I learned <b> how to make the app interactive, the difference between stateful and stateless widgets and how to use state in Flutter projects </b> by developing a simple magic 8 ball app capable of helping one to make decisions by randomly choosing an answer in a set of images.
